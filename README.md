## Overview

A silly little programming language that doesn't do a lot.

For a while now I've been really interested in writing my own programming
language. I was first inspired when I saw
[this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JP9n5wHyemU) video about someone else
who had done the very thing. A few months later, I learned a bit about lexers
and parsers and all things of the sort, and here we are now.

Note that right now, this language is effectively useless. We're in pre-alpha
right now and the only thing the interpreter does at the moment is print
'Hello, world!'. Stay tuned for further developments.

## Building

I put the commands in the big code blocks for the people who scroll straight to
the `building` section and type in all the commands in order. To compile the
project and build the JAR file, run the following command:

```
ant build
```

To run the interactive shell, run the command below:

```
ant run
```
